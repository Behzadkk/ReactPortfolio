One of the major challenges was reconciling accounts, as we needed to ensure that all transactions were accurately recorded and reconciled between different systems. To overcome this challenge, we developed a comprehensive automated reconciliation system that reconciled all transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between wallets.",
        "Another challenge was handling external events initiated outside of FinBlocks. We needed to ensure that any external events, such as direct debit payouts, were properly recorded and processed in our system. To address this, we developed a robust system that integrated external events with our system, ensuring that all transactions were properly recorded and processed.",

This integration greatly improved the user experience, as users can now directly transfer funds to their wallets through their dedicated bank accounts automatically. Additionally, they can withdraw money or set up direct debits against these accounts, streamlining the financial management process."

The platform previously only supported GBP transactions, and it was essential to extend it to accept other currencies such as USD and EUR. I worked on creating the necessary logic and integrating APIs for currency exchange rates.",

To handle this, I implemented a daily exchange rate update process that retrieves the latest exchange rates from a reliable source and updates them in the system. I also created conversion rules for each currency, so the system could handle any conversions accurately.",

This ensures that the company is meeting regulatory requirements and maintaining accurate financial records. By automating this process, FinBlocks was able to significantly reduce the risk of errors and improve the efficiency of their reconciliation process.",
        "To create this report, I used a combination of programming languages and tools, including Node.js, MongoDB, event sourcing, and Excel. Node.js  was used for data extraction and manipulation, while MongoDb and EventStore was used to query and extract data from the company's database. Excel was then used to generate the final report, which is easy to read and provides a comprehensive overview of the reconciliation status.",

This simplifies the application process and enables users to stay up-to-date with new opportunities as they become available.",
        "One of the key features of the app is its focus on user experience. The app has been designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with a streamlined interface that enables users to quickly find and apply for projects. Additionally, the app is built with scalability in mind, ensuring that it can accommodate a growing user base as the organisation expands its services.",
        "Overall, the job market app is a powerful tool for Iranian Community North East to help refugees and marginalized individuals find new opportunities and connect with the wider community. It serves as an important means of supporting integration efforts, while also delivering a seamless user experience to app users."
